    <h2>The Cheetah</h2>
    <p>Cheetahs are the fastest land animal on Earth, reaching speeds of up to 70 miles per hour in 
       just three seconds.Cheetahs have tawny coats with black spots that are unique to each individual, 
       like human fingerprints. They also have black tear lines that run from the inner corners of their 
       eyes to the sides of their mouths. Adult cheetahs are 3.7 to 4.6 feet long, with a tail that is 2 
       to 2.7 feet long. They weigh between 77 and 143 pounds, with males being slightly larger than females. 
       Cheetahs hunt small to medium-sized prey, such as springbok, gazelle, and impala. They stalk their 
       prey from a distance of 200 to 330 feet, then charge, trip, and bite the throat to kill. 
       Cheetahs live in three main social groups: females and their cubs, male coalitions, and solitary 
       males. Male coalitions are made up of two or three males, often brothers, who live and hunt together. 
       Cheetahs live an average of up to 14 years in the wild, and up to 20 years in captivity. 
       Cheetahs are threatened by larger predators, such as lions, leopards, wild dogs, and hyenas. 
       Cheetahs live in a variety of habitats, including savannahs, arid mountain ranges, and hilly 
       desert terrain. The cheetah is the world's fastest land animal and Africa's most endangered big cat.
